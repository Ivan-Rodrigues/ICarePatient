# Mobile Hub #

The Mobile Hub (M-Hub) is a general-purpose middleware that enables mobile personal devices (Android smartphones and tablets) to become the propagator nodes (i.e. gateways to the Internet) for the simpler IoT objects or Mobile Objects (M-OBJ) (sensors/actuators) with only short-range WPAN interfaces. It provides context information such as current local time and/or the (approximate) location to the data obtained from the M-OBJs to which it is connected. The M-Hub is the natural extension of the Scalable Data Distribution Layer (SDDL).
